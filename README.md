# Unsupervised Machine Learning

<img src=/images/cover.png width=500, height="350">

In this repository, you will find code snippets and practical examples to build proficiency in various unsupervised machine-learning techniques. These resources help users grasp core concepts and apply them to real-world data. The topics covered include:

- Clustering: Techniques such as K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), DBSCAN, and more.
- Dimensionality Reduction: Methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for simplifying complex data.
- Association Rules: Understanding relationships between variables within large datasets.
- Auto-Encoders: Implementing neural network-based models for data compression and anomaly detection.

All code is written in Python and organised into multiple Jupyter Notebooks for easy exploration and execution. The repository also includes a 'data' folder containing various datasets to facilitate hands-on learning as you run the provided notebooks.
